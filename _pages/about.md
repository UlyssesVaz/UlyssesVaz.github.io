About Me:
======= 

My first presentation in elementary school was on Apple after the iPhone launch. Having just learned about ENIAC, I was fascinated by how technology creates opportunities and how business brings those opportunities to people. From that moment, I knew I wanted to work at the intersection of business and technology. 

At the University of Washington, I interned at Deloitte accounting and tax, where I gained a high-level view of how organizations operate. But I wanted to move beyond understanding businesses and learn how to use them as vehicles to drive opportunity through technology. That led me into a double major my Senior year and get a Master's of Science in Information Systems, where I built an AI-powered fitness assistant app that helps new users build sustainable health habits. 

That project strengthened my ability to apply emerging technologies to real-world challenges and to lead with vision. 
Iâ€™m excited to keep exploring opportunities at the intersection of business and technology to create oppurtunities that better humanity.
