Welcome to my website

About Me:
======= 

I’m a Master’s student in Information Systems at the University of Washington, focusing on AI, machine learning, cloud computing, and data analytics. I bridge business and technology, combining my accounting background and an internship at Deloitte with hands-on project experience—from user research and prototyping to implementing AI solutions.

I’ve built projects like an AI-powered fitness assistant and am currently exploring computer vision with real-world datasets. There, I scoped out areas of friction in my own life, took user research and protyped the app to help people develop sustainable health habits. This project strengthened my ability to apply emerging technologies to real-world challenges and lead with vision.

I’m looking for roles in product or business analysis where I can apply both technical and business insight. 
Long-term, I aspire to grow into a technical leader who can inspire teams, shape strategy, and deliver meaningful solutions.
