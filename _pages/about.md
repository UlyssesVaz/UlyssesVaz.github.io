Welcome to my website

About Me:
======= 

My first presentation in elementary school was on Apple after the iPhone launch. Having just learned about ENIAC, I became fascinated by how quickly technology can open new opportunities and how business can deliver those opportunities to people. From that moment, I knew I wanted to work at the intersection of business and technology. 

At the University of Washington, I interned at Deloitte, where I gained a high-level view of how organizations operate, including med-tech B2B subscription models for employee wellness. But I wanted to go beyond understanding businesses and start using them as vehicles to drive opportunity. That led me to add a double major in Information Systems my senior year and pursue an M.S. in Information Systems.

There, I scoped out areas of friction in my own life and built an AI-powered fitness assistant app to help people develop sustainable health habits. This project strengthened my ability to apply emerging technologies to real-world challenges and lead with vision.

In the next 5–10 years, I see myself as a leader in a technology platform organization, continuing to create opportunities that improve people’s lives.
