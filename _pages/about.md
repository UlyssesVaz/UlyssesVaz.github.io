Welcome to my website

About Me:
======= 

I’m a Master’s student in Information Systems at the University of Washington, focusing on AI, machine learning, cloud computing, and data analytics. I bridge business and technology and have applied these skills in projects like an AI-powered fitness assistant. In that project, I identified areas of friction in daily life, conducted user research, and prototyped the app to help people develop sustainable health habits. It strengthened my ability to apply emerging technologies to real-world challenges while thinking strategically and leading with vision.

Previously, I earned a bachelor’s in Accounting & Information Systems and interned at Deloitte in Audit & Assurance. There, I collaborated with clients across industries, which strengthened my communication, problem-solving, and ability to work with large datasets under tight deadlines.

I’m interested in product management or business analysis roles where I can combine technical and business insight. Ultimately, I aspire to grow into a technical leader who can inspire teams, shape strategy, and deliver meaningful solutions.
